# Python Basics Notebook (SGU_PPNCKH)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental Python programming concepts, numerical computing with NumPy, and data visualization with Matplotlib.

## Contents

The repository contains two main notebooks:

### TH01b.ipynb - Python Fundamentals

1. **Basic Python Concepts**

    - Library imports and basic operators
    - Data types: integers, floats, strings, boolean, None, Tuple, List, Set, Dictionary
    - Input/output operations

2. **Control Structures**

    - Conditional statements (if)
    - Loop structures (for, while)
    - List comprehensions

3. **Exception Handling & Functions**

    - Try/except blocks
    - Function definitions and usage

4. **Advanced Data Structures**
    - List operations and manipulations
    - Sets and Dictionaries
    - Collection operations

### TH01c.ipynb - Numerical Computing

1. **Array Operations with NumPy**

    - Random array generation
    - Array statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation)
    - Array operations and comparisons

2. **Matrix Operations**

    - Matrix creation and manipulation
    - Matrix transposition
    - Matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
    - Solving linear equations

3. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib**
    - Plotting frequency distributions
